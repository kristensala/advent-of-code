# ADVENT OF CODE
## 2022
Started with Golang but decided after two solutions to move over to Rust.

## Good to know
To run each binary separatelly `cargo run --bin day1`

## Ownership & borrow checker
### aoc2022 day5
First problems started in day5. Because of that the solution took quite a long time.
I still don't understand it, so the rearrange() method looks quite messy.

## Something different
### aoc 2022 day6 https://github.com/kristensala/advent-of-code/blob/master/src/bin/day6.rs 
Used XOR to find a duplicate in array. I'm not sure if it's faster, would be interesting to test this solution on bigger data
